im currently recieving random bsods on my main pc so this file was generated from my old one as the new one is getting repaired at the service cemtre

git is no blogging platform but i still think this needs to be here as this is the actual fil firsst time since 2016 that i have not resolved an issue on my own

day 2 : its a weird experience for me not being able to work feels bad and at the same time it was a needed break just came too early
